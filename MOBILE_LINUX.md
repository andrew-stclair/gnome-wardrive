- **OnePlus 6/6T** (postmarketOS)
- **Fairphone 4** (Ubuntu Touch, postmarketOS)
- **Raspberry Pi 4+** (Any ARM64 Linux distribution)

### Mobile Linux Distributions
- **postmarketOS**: Alpine-based mobile Linux
- **Mobian**: Debian-based mobile Linux  
- **Manjaro ARM**: Arch-based mobile Linux
- **PureOS**: Debian-based (Librem 5 default)
- **Ubuntu Touch**: Convergent mobile OS
- **Fedora Mobile**: Red Hat mobile variant

## üöÄ Installation on Mobile Devices

### Method 1: Direct Installation (Recommended)

1. **Download the ARM64 package** to your mobile device:
   ```bash
   # On your mobile device  
   wget https://github.com/andrew-stclair/gnome-wardrive/releases/latest/download/gnome-wardrive_*_arm64.deb
   ```

2. **Install the package**:
   # Debian/Ubuntu based (Mobian, PureOS)
   sudo dpkg -i gnome-wardrive_*_arm64.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix any missing dependencies
   ```

3. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   gnome-wardrive
   ```

### Method 2: Transfer from Desktop

1. **Download on desktop** and transfer via SSH/USB:
   ```bash
   # On desktop
   wget https://github.com/andrew-stclair/gnome-wardrive/releases/latest/download/gnome-wardrive_*_arm64.deb
   
   # Transfer to mobile device (replace with your device IP)
   scp gnome-wardrive_*_arm64.deb user@mobile-device-ip:~/
   ```

2. **Install on mobile device**:
   ```bash
   # On mobile device
   sudo dpkg -i ~/gnome-wardrive_*_arm64.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix dependencies
   ```

### Method 3: Build from Source

For distributions that don't support .deb packages:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andrew-stclair/gnome-wardrive.git
cd gnome-wardrive

# Install dependencies (adapt for your package manager)
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-requests python3-gpxpy \
                 gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 gir1.2-nm-1.0 \
                 gir1.2-geoclue-2.0 meson ninja-build

# Build and install
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
sudo meson install -C builddir
```

## üîß Mobile-Specific Configuration

### Touch Interface Optimization
The application is designed with mobile-first principles:
- **48px minimum touch targets** for finger navigation
- **Adaptive layout** that works from 320px to desktop sizes
- **Bottom action bar** for thumb-friendly access
- **Swipe-friendly list views** for network browsing

### Battery Optimization
For extended mobile wardriving sessions:

1. **Enable battery saver mode** in your mobile OS
2. **Reduce screen brightness** when not actively viewing
3. **Use airplane mode + WiFi** to disable cellular radio
4. **Close unnecessary background apps**

### Permission Requirements
The app uses D-Bus interfaces that work in Flatpak sandboxes:
- **NetworkManager access**: Passive WiFi scanning (no special permissions)
- **GeoClue access**: GPS location services
- **Home directory access**: For exporting scan data

## üìä Mobile Wardriving Tips

### Optimal Mobile Setup
1. **Portable power bank**: Extended battery life for long sessions
2. **Car mount**: Hands-free operation while mobile
3. **External GPS antenna**: Better location accuracy (if supported)
4. **Offline maps**: For correlating WiFi data with locations

### Data Management
- **Regular exports**: Save scan data frequently (CSV/KML/GPX formats)
- **Cloud sync**: Upload data to prevent loss
- **Storage monitoring**: Keep adequate free space for scan data

### Mobile Performance
- **ARM64 native builds**: No emulation overhead
- **Lightweight UI**: Optimized for mobile CPUs
- **Efficient scanning**: Passive monitoring minimizes battery drain

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Mobile Issues

### Common Mobile Problems

**GPS not working:**
```bash
# Check if location services are enabled
systemctl --user status geoclue
```

**WiFi scanning not finding networks:**
```bash
# Verify NetworkManager is running
systemctl status NetworkManager

# Check if WiFi device is available
nmcli device status
```

**Touch interface not responsive:**
- Ensure GTK4 touch support is enabled
- Check if compositor supports touch events
- Verify screen calibration

**Performance issues:**
- Close background applications
- Ensure adequate RAM (minimum 1GB recommended)
- Check CPU thermal throttling

### Mobile-Specific Logs
View application logs for mobile debugging:
```bash
# Run with debug output
gnome-wardrive --verbose

# Check system logs for NetworkManager issues
journalctl -u NetworkManager

# Check application logs
journalctl --user | grep gnome-wardrive
```
