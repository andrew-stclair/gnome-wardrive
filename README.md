# GNOME Wardrive

A modern GNOME application for WiFi wardriving built with Python, GTK4, and Libadwaita.  
**Optimized for Linux mobile devices** like PinePhone, Librem 5, and postmarketOS.

## Features

- **üì± Mobile Linux First** - Native ARM64 builds for PinePhone, Librem 5, postmarketOS devices
- **üîÑ Adaptive Interface** - Touch-optimized UI that works from 320px phone screens to desktop
- **üì° System WiFi Scanning** - Uses NetworkManager D-Bus API (no root required)
- **üåç GPS Location Tracking** - Native GeoClue integration for accurate positioning
- **üíæ Multiple Export Formats** - CSV, KML, GPX for analysis and mapping
- **üëÜ Touch-Friendly Design** - 48px minimum touch targets, bottom action bars
- **üé® Native GNOME Integration** - Libadwaita styling, adaptive layouts
- **üì¶ Native Packaging** - Debian packages for x86_64 and aarch64

## WiFi Scanning

This application uses a **passive WiFi monitoring** approach that works reliably across different Linux systems:

- **Passive Monitoring**: Detects networks that are actively beaconing or being scanned by other devices
- **No System Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box without requiring special permissions or system modifications  
- **Native Integration**: Direct access to NetworkManager for optimal performance
- **Cross-Platform**: Same behavior across different Linux distributions and device types

The app continuously monitors NetworkManager's cache of visible access points, which is updated whenever:
- Networks broadcast beacon frames (most APs do this every 100ms)
- Other applications or the system perform WiFi scans
- Users manually refresh WiFi in system settings

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- GTK4 (4.14+)
- Libadwaita (1.5+)
- NetworkManager
- GeoClue2
- PyGObject

## Building & Installation

### Debian Package (Recommended)

For Debian/Ubuntu systems, build and install as a native package:

```bash

```

#### Manual Debian Package Build

If you prefer to build manually:

```bash
# Install build dependencies
sudo apt-get install debhelper dh-python python3-all python3-setuptools \
                     meson ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-4-dev \
                     libadwaita-1-dev python3-gi-dev gir1.2-gtk-4.0 \
                     gir1.2-adw-1 gir1.2-nm-1.0 libnm-dev libglib2.0-dev \
                     glib-compile-resources desktop-file-utils appstream-util \
                     build-essential devscripts lintian

# Build the package
debuild -us -uc -b
```

### Development & Testing

```bash
