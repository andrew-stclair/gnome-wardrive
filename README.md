# GNOME Wardrive

A modern GNOME application for WiFi wardriving built with Python, GTK4, and Libadwaita.

## Features

- **Mobile-First Design** - Adaptive interface optimized for phones and tablets
- **Portable WiFi monitoring** using NetworkManager (works in Flatpak sandboxes)
- **GPS location tracking** via GeoClue
- **Multiple export formats** (CSV, KML, GPX)
- **Touch-friendly controls** with 48px minimum touch targets
- **Responsive layout** that adapts from 320px to desktop sizes
- **Native GNOME integration** with Libadwaita
- **Flatpak packaging** for easy cross-platform distribution

## WiFi Scanning

This application uses a **passive WiFi monitoring** approach that works reliably across different systems and inside Flatpak sandboxes:

- **Passive Monitoring**: Detects networks that are actively beaconing or being scanned by other devices
- **No System Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box without requiring special permissions or system modifications  
- **Flatpak Compatible**: Full functionality when installed as a sandboxed Flatpak application
- **Cross-Platform**: Same behavior across different Linux distributions and device types

The app continuously monitors NetworkManager's cache of visible access points, which is updated whenever:
- Networks broadcast beacon frames (most APs do this every 100ms)
- Other applications or the system perform WiFi scans
- Users manually refresh WiFi in system settings

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- GTK4 (4.14+)
- Libadwaita (1.5+)
- NetworkManager
- GeoClue2
- PyGObject
- GNOME Platform 47 (for Flatpak builds)

## Installation

### Multi-Architecture Flatpak Bundles

Pre-built Flatpak bundles are available for multiple architectures from GitHub Actions or Releases:

**Supported Architectures:**
- **x86_64**: Intel/AMD 64-bit systems (most desktops and laptops)
- **aarch64**: ARM 64-bit systems (mobile devices, Raspberry Pi, ARM SBCs)

**Installation Steps:**
1. **Check your architecture**: `uname -m`
2. **Download** the appropriate bundle from [Releases](https://github.com/andrew-stclair/gnome-wardrive/releases) or [Actions](https://github.com/andrew-stclair/gnome-wardrive/actions)
3. **Install**: `flatpak install com.andrewstclair.Wardrive-{arch}.flatpak` 
4. **Run**: `flatpak run com.andrewstclair.Wardrive`

**Architecture Selection:**
- If `uname -m` shows `x86_64` → Download `com.andrewstclair.Wardrive-x86_64.flatpak`
- If `uname -m` shows `aarch64` or `arm64` → Download `com.andrewstclair.Wardrive-aarch64.flatpak`
